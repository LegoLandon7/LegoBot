# LegoBot
this bot is made by me (cc_landonlego) however ive used chatgpt for a lot of help on this mainly as a learning tool

to clone this bot, make sure to add an .env file with inside being
    TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
and replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' with your bot token then do 'npm install dotenv' in terminal
