# LegoBot
this bot is made by me (cc_landonlego) however ive used chatgpt for a lot of help on this mainly as a learning tool

chatgpt as a learning tool has helped me understand many concepts of making a discord bot and im starting to use less and less of it as I go on, this is one of the first big projects ive done

to clone this bot, make sure to add an .env file with inside being
    TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
and replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' with your bot token then do 'npm install dotenv' in terminal
