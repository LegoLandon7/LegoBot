# LegoBot
this bot is made by me (cc_landonlego) however ive used chatgpt for a lot of help on this mainly as a learning tool

Add the bot! -> https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1432705622771765439&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands

chatgpt as a learning tool has helped me understand many concepts of making a discord bot and im starting to use less and less of it as I go on, this is one of the first big projects ive done

-- HOW TO CLONE AND RUN THE BOT --

to clone this bot, make sure to add an .env file with inside being
    TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
and replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' with your bot token then do 'npm install dotenv' in terminal

afterwards just do 'node index.js' in the terminal to start it, then do 'ctrl c' bind to stop it

keep in mind any changes done will require you to restart the bot
